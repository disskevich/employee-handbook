# Employee Acknowledgement

This is to acknowledge that I have received a copy of Zinc's Employee Handbook,
and I understand that it contains important information on Zinc's general
personnel policies and on my privileges and obligations as an employee. I will
read the Handbook, and I understand that I am governed by its contents.

I understand that Zinc may change, rescind or add to any policies, benefits or
practices described in the Handbook from time to time in its sole discretion,
with or without notice. I understand that the statements in the Handbook are
guidelines only and not intended to create any contractual or other legal
obligations, express or implied. I understand that a master copy of this
Handbook, including all of the latest updates, will be kept in Zinc's files.

I agree and understand that Zinc and I have the right to terminate my
employment at any time, with or without advance notice and for any reason or no
reason. This at-will employment relationship can be modified only in writing
signed by the executives of Zinc. I acknowledge that no statements or
representations regarding my employment can alter this policy. Finally, I
understand and agree that this Acknowledgment contains a full and complete
statement of the agreements and understandings that it recites, that no one has
made any promises or commitments to me contrary to the foregoing, and that this
Acknowledgment supersedes all previous agreements, whether written or oral,
