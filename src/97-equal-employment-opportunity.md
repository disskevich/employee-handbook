# Equal Employment Opportunity

Zinc's aspirations to create a diverse and inclusive company far exceed the
legal description of "equal employment" below. However, in accordance with
legal requirements as an employer, we are including this language.

It is our belief that all people are entitled to equal employment
opportunities. Zinc assures equal treatment in the administration of all
personnel matters including recruitment, selection, hiring, compensation,
benefits, advancement, training, disciplinary action, and transfer, without
regard to race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical
disability, mental disability, legally protected medical condition, genetic
characteristics, genetic information, marital status, sex (including pregnancy,
childbirth, breastfeeding and/or related medical conditions), sexual
orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, military or
veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law. Zinc
also makes reasonable accommodations for disabled employees, and for pregnant
employees who, with the advice of their health care provider, request an
accommodation.

Zinc will not tolerate any unlawful discrimination or harassment of an employee
in any of the areas listed above. Any employee who violates this policy is
subject to discipline up to and including discharge.
